/**
 * This is a set of tests for the normal Waiter interaction cycle. This suite
 * tests all of the waiter messages, with a single customer. Note, this does not
 * test multiple customers. These are contained in the
 * WaiterAgentTestsWithTwoCustomers. <br>
 * <br>
 * Note that the unit of test in this file is the individual message. We call
 * the appropriate functions to get the WaiterAgent ready to accept and process
 * a particular message and then make assert statements surrounding that
 * message. This breaks testing this one interaction up into 5 different test
 * methods. You could also integrate all of this into one large test method. We
 * do this when testing a WaiterAgent with multiple customers. Both styles are
 * valid and which one is best depends on the goal of your particular tests. <br>
 * This set of tests is invaluable when first writing your WaiterAgent. It will
 * validate that your waiter implements the messaging contract described in the
 * interaction diagram. In building an agent system, I would actually write
 * these unit tests before writing the WaiterAgent itself. This practice is
 * called Test Driven Development (TDD).
